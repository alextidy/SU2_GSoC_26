# GSoC SU2 Assignments

## Assignment 1: Compiling and Installing
Nothing of note. A build with Python wrapper = true and MPI enabled was used for the following tasks.

## Assignment 2: Steady, Axisymmetric Turbulent Jet
### Mesh
A .geo file (see repo) was setup and converted to .su2 using gmsh. A 2D trapezoidal mesh was used to minimise number of elements.   

### Solver Setup
The stream was modelled as incompressible (M<<0.3).

SST was chosen as the turbulence model, due to []. 


### Results
![Results not found](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Codecademy/docs/main/media/codey.jpg)
The axial distribution followed the theoretical asymptotic behaviour and matched experimental data from [].

The radial distribution was slightly less well-matched. This is because ...
